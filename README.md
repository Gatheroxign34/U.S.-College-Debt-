    <h1> Do factors such as region, ethnicity and college size affect average student Debt in the U.S.?  </h1>
        <p> This project explores this question using U.S Department of Education Data data with Python, Seaborn and Scipy Stats </p>
        <p> Inquiry: Investigated patterns in average college debt by U.S. region, college size, and ethnicity to help stakeholders understand the           inner workings of the U.S. college debt crisis.</p> 
        <p> Created regional groupings with NumPy and Pandas and interpreted SciPy Stats Pearson r correlation coefficient tests to compare average         median income and average debt by region.</p> 
        <p> Built independent t-test models using NumPy, Pandas and SciPy Stats to determine differences in average college debt between ethnic 
        groups at the small college and large university level.</p> 
        <p> Analysis:Learned that overall median income is lower for graduates in the southeast although average college debt is equal nationwide; 
        and revealed that ethnicity affects average college debt for small colleges (total students < 2999) but has little effect for large 
        universities (total students > = 10,000).</p>
